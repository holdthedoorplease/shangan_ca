# 电话催签

<div class="dividing-line"></div>

在所有的催签办法中，电话催签是最简单直接的。电话催签的原理是IRCC的接线员答应你在系统中给你的申请leave a note，标注你有来电且要求尽快办理。签证官登陆系统的时候就会看到这则消息，如果觉得有必要，签证官会打开你的案子进行处理。当然，大部分时候，签证官会选择无视。

电话催签有2大难关：一是电话比较难打通，二是接线员可能会拒绝帮你催签。

快速打通IRCC电话(1-888-242-2100)有一些技巧：

如果接线员拒绝帮你催签，不要强求，更不要辱骂对方，挂掉电话再拨打一次即可。因为接线员的个人素质不同、对业务的熟悉程度不同，所以多打几个电话，试试不同的接线员就好。

按照上面的「2-3-1-0」攻略打通电话后，设法说服接线员帮你在系统里备注下。方法有很多，总的来说是「晓之以理，动之以情」。下面的模版供参考：

- **签证超过了「平均处理时长」：**

```{admonition} 催签模版
Dear Officer, I’ve been checking the processing times on the IRCC website, and I noticed that my application has been in progress longer than expected. This delay is really starting to impact my life — I’ve already paid for my rent, and I had to reschedule my flight again and again. The uncertainty has been quite stressful, and I’m feeling a lot of pressure because of it. If possible, could you please leave a note in the system to let the visa officer know that my application has gone past the estimated processing time? I’d be incredibly grateful if this could help prompt a decision. Thanks so much for your assistance and for taking the time to help me — I truly appreciate it.
```

- **签证没超过「平均处理时长」，但有紧急事由：**

```{admonition} 催签模版
Dear Officer, I have an urgent situation. My school program starts in just two weeks, and I’ve already booked my flight. I’m really worried about not being able to make it on time. If possible, could you please leave a note in the system to let the visa officer know about my situation? I’d be so grateful if this could help with a decision before my start date. Thank you so much for your understanding and help. I really appreciate it!
```


- **签证没超过「平均处理时长」也没有紧急事由，但担心不能准时下签**

这种情况下不太推荐催签，以免浪费IRCC的资源。但如果你特别特别担心不能准时下签，而及时下签对你非常非常重要，你可以告诉接线员，希望对方帮你备注。从实际情况来看，这种催签成功率不高，如果没有特殊情况，耐心等待就好。

```{admonition} 催签模版
Dear Officer, I hope there aren’t any issues that might delay my application. Receiving the result on time is very important to me — my flight and housing plans depend on it, and more importantly, my school program will start soon. A delay would be extremely challenging for me. If possible, could you please leave a note in the system to highlight that it’s essential for my application to stay on track? I’d be very grateful for your help, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to assist me. Thank you!

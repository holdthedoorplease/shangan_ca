**Key Programs:**

**Important Considerations:**

- **Eligibility:** Not everyone is eligible to seek asylum in Canada. Factors such as previous criminal convictions or prior refugee claims in Canada may affect eligibility.

- **Safe Third Country Agreement:** Under this agreement, individuals must claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. This means that those entering Canada from the U.S. at a land port of entry may be ineligible to make a refugee claim in Canada.

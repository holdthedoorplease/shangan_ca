Family Class Immigration
========================================

Family Class Immigration allows Canadian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor eligible family members to become permanent residents of Canada. This program aims to reunite families by enabling them to live, work, and study in Canada.

**Key Features:**

- **Eligibility:** Sponsors must be at least 18 years old and either a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. They must demonstrate the financial ability to support the sponsored family member(s) and ensure they do not require social assistance. For more details, refer to the [IRCC eligibility criteria](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/spouse-partner-children.html).

- **Who Can Be Sponsored:** Eligible family members include:
  - **Spouses, Common-law Partners, and Conjugal Partners**
  - **Dependent Children**
  - **Parents and Grandparents**
  - **Other Relatives:** Under certain conditions, other relatives may also be eligible.
  
  Full details on eligible family members are available on the [IRCC page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/who-you-can-sponsor.html).

- **Application Process:** The application process involves two main steps:
  1. **Sponsorâ€™s Application:** The sponsor applies to sponsor a family member.
  2. **Permanent Residence Application:** The sponsored family member applies for permanent residence.
  
  Both applications are submitted simultaneously. For detailed instructions, visit the [application process guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/other-relatives/apply.html).

- **Processing Times:** Processing times vary based on the family member being sponsored and their country of residence. Check the latest [processing times on the IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html).

- **Financial Obligations:** Sponsors must sign an undertaking committing to provide financial support for the basic needs of the sponsored person and, if applicable, their dependent children. The duration of this commitment varies based on the relationship and age of the sponsored person.
